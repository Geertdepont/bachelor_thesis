<h3>Description</h3>
Coding standards are guidelines that all developers follow in a project follow to improve collaboration.
When non-logical variable or function names are used, it becomes harder for others to understand the code. 
Which results in time loss.
There also exists coding standard files which can be linked to your AndroidStudio project. 
This is often used because whenever a line of code does not match the coding standard this is automatically shown.
An example coding standard file can be found <a href="https://github.com/ustwo/android-coding-standards">here.</a>
Which follows the official Android coding standards: https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page]{:target="_blank"} which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

Always handle your exceptions. You might think that an exception would not occur. But itâ€™s 
hard to trace back, if you do not handle them.
Do not catch generic exceptions. If someone adds another exception to the method which throws the exception, you might 
spend more time retrieving the exception, since you did not know what caused it.
