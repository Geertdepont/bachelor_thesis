<h3>Why?</h3>
Using well-defined coding standards is necessary when collaborating. When non-logical variable or function names are used, it becomes harder for others to understand the code.
Therefore use coding standards.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page] which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

Always handle your exceptions. You might think that an exception would not occur. But itâ€™s 
hard to trace back, if you do not handle them.
Do not catch generic exceptions. If someone adds another exception to the method which throws the exception, you might 
spend more time retrieving the exception, since you did not know what caused it.
