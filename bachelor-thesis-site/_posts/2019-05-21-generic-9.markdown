<h3>Why?</h3>
Using interfaces for linking modules, is a great way for module communication. 
This way modules can’t access methods that are not declared in the interface. 
And helps define a clear overview of what each module does. 
Using interfaces for linking modules, is a great way for module communication. 
This way modules can’t access methods that are not declared in the interface. 
And helps define a clear overview of what each module does. 

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page]{:target="_blank"} which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

If we take a look at the Presenter and Repository modules, we see they communicate 
exclusively via interfaces. 
The MainPresenter implements the <b> OnViewEmployeesFinishedListener </b>.
Which contains the methods: 

<ul>
<li><b>onError </b> Which will be called when an error occurs in the Repository</li>
<li><b>onSuccess </b> Which will be called when the Repository successfully retrieves the employees</li>
</ul>              
                    
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/e8e9996406425a39462b5f03ec0896ff.js"></script>

The MainPresenter calls the <b>employeeRepository.getList(this)</b> giving itself as parameter.
The Repository communicates back by calling the methods of the
OnViewEmployeesFinishedListener interface.
OnError() is called if there does not exists a cache and the service does not work.
OnSuccess() is called if the data is successfully retrieved from cache, or is newly retrieved from the network.
