<h3>Why?</h3>
Not only does this abstract away from the Android framework. 
But also improves the testability of the Presenters. 
Make the Activities implement a view interface. 
This also prevents the Presenter to access methods which should not be accessible from the Activity. 

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page].

As described above the presenter is dependent on views and not the activity.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/7e57da2825201c7246ad8599e9fb9abd.js"></script>

The GreetPresenter has only a reference to a GreetView.
The GreetActivity implements the GreetView.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/a75d3679705df490bdae794dfcc1bbee.js"></script>

The GreetPresenter makes changes to the Activity via the view.
To show the message, <b>mGreetView.showMessage(mCredentials.getPersonalizedGreeting());</b> is being called.

Which in the mainActivity is described as:
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/da05a619efc529decd2db3c7c0298d3f.js"></script>

The message has been added to the TextView <b>personalGreetingTextView</b>.
