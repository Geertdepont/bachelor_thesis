<h3>Why?</h3>
Not only does this abstract away from the Android framework. 
But also improves the testability of the Presenters. 
Make the Activities implement a view interface. 
This also prevents the Presenter to access methods which should not be accessible from the Activity. 

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page].

As described above the presenter is dependent on views and not the activity.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/fc1bed409951ee9254f7aeeb7d6f4de6.js"></script>

The Presenter has only a reference to a view.
