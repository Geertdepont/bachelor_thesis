<h3>Why?</h3>
The single responsibility principle from the SOLID principles, leads to a creating a model for 
each future of the app. 
Each ViewModel references to itâ€™s own repository instead of referencing the database directly.
 This results in cleaner code, and repetitions of the similar code.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example].

Every viewModel creates its own repository, which in its turn has access to the one database.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/0cf01c5b3504ad226e946d261908cf44.js"></script>

And the NoteRepository has access to the global used database.
