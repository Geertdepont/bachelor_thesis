doc: "In accordance to guidelines CLEAN-1
      and CLEAN-2, presenters residing in the outer layers of
      apps modeled through clean architecture principles should
      be kept lightweight. In fact, Presenters should be composed
      with interactor components, i.e., use cases residing in the
      business logic layers, which are responsible for executing tasks
      outside the main UI thread of the app. Once the task are
      finished, the Views are updated through a callback with the
      processed data. Besides callback-based communication among
      components, other techniques used in order to keep the UI
      thread lightweight rely on the inversion of control principle
      and intent-based communication."

<h3>Why?</h3>
In accordance to guidelines CLEAN-1
and CLEAN-2, presenters residing in the outer layers of
apps modeled through clean architecture principles should
be kept lightweight. In fact, Presenters should be composed
with interactor components, i.e., use cases residing in the
business logic layers, which are responsible for executing tasks
outside the main UI thread of the app. Once the task are
finished, the Views are updated through a callback with the
processed data. Besides callback-based communication among
components, other techniques used in order to keep the UI
thread lightweight rely on the inversion of control principle
and intent-based communication.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page]{:target="_blank"}. The event diagram of the MVP login:

Each presenter in our MVP Login example contains an interactor. And performs the job in a 
new thread, and comes back using a callback.

This keeps the UI thread lighter than when the MainActivity would perform the request on the MainThread.
