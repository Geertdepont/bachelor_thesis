<h3>Why?</h3>
For example, to ensure that Views display upto-date content, it is recommended that ViewModels expose
states rather than just events. This can be achieved by bundling
together the data that needs to be displayed. In such way,
when one of the fields to be displayed changes, a new state is
emitted and the View is updated. This entails that each user
interaction involves an action in the ViewModel, enabling a
clean separation of concerns between MVVM components.


<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example]{:target="_blank"}.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVVM_event.png" alt="MVVM event diagram" width="85%">
</figure>

This is our whole application.
	There is no business logic in the view.
	All the business logic is moved to the ViewModel
When we want to add a new Note we start a new AddNoteActivity.
If we submit the form with the Note details, the note is then submitted to the NoteViewModel which then handles the request.

      <td>[On MVVM] The importance of a well designed view entity. One common mistake is to pass the view an object that hasn’t been designed for it, usually because we don’t want to create another object that is specific for the view, so we rather just pass the one that comes from our data or domain layer. This should be avoided because it means that the view needs to do some final transformations to be able to consume it, leaving code that contains untested logic. In our experience, the most critical step working in the presentation layer is the design of the view entities. Creating these POJOs is in a way the main goal of the presentation layer and defines how readable, understandable and testable the whole layer is. [Nice quote on MVVM] Take your time designing the view entities. You don’t want to deal with a poorly designed one and it is painful to change them when the implementation of the presentation layer is advanced.</td>

      <td>Expose states and not events: expose one stream per view that emits states instead of events. Both the position and the data set should be wrapped up together so the ViewPager never receives one without the other. This is true for any view with intradependent state. You would never expose two separate streams for a TextView, one that sets the text and another one that emits the position of the letter that should be highlighted in bold, but for some reason it’s much easier to make this mistake with a ViewPager or lists.
