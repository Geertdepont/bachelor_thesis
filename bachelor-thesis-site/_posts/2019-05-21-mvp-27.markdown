<h3>Why?</h3>
Fragments are destroyed and recreated with their parent Activity.
The setRetainInstance in a fragment, allows us to skip this cycle.
The fragment is then retained. This is used to avoid memory leaks.


<h3>Example</h3>
Due to time issues, I did not create an example for retaining fragments, but here is a good example.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/d86d93767d2f95073716f3c926720d5a.js"></script>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/9f0fd8ea570f16fcc05df5c091fd7873.js"></script>

If the fragment already started before, then it does not have to be created.
