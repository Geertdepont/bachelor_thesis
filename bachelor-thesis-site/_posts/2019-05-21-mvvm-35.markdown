<h3>Why?</h3>
Instead of emitting a stream for each feature of the model, emit the whole model. This results in up-to-date models.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example].

When we display all the notes. We display all the features of note of each note encapsulated 
in a LiveData object. This stream will emit every time a change happens in this object.
