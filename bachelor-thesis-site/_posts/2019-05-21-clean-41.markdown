<h3>Why?</h3>
By implementing a data model at every
layer, a high degree of decoupling between layers can be
achieved. Specifically, by following this guideline, the outer
layers of apps can be implemented without any explicit knowledge of the implementation details of the inner layers. This
means that the origin of the data becomes transparent to the
client and hence, in a repository pattern fashion, data sources
can be added, removed, or changed without much effort.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page]. 

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVPLogin_depicted.png" alt="Login depicted" width="600">
</figure>

Each layer works with its own model.
The View layer works with the Presenter.
The Presenter works with the Model.
If we change the way we store the data from the model, the View would not need to know.
Since the View receives the same data.
