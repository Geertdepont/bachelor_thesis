<h3>Why?</h3>
By implementing a data model at every
layer, a high degree of decoupling between layers can be
achieved. Specifically, by following this guideline, the outer
layers of apps can be implemented without any explicit knowledge of the implementation details of the inner layers. This
means that the origin of the data becomes transparent to the
client and hence, in a repository pattern fashion, data sources
can be added, removed, or changed without much effort.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page]. The event diagram of the MVP login:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVPLogin_injection.png" alt="Login Injection" width="700">
</figure>

Each layer works with its own model. If we change the way we implement validation of our 
credentials. We do not need to change our Presenter.
