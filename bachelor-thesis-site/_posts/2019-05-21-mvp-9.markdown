<h3>Description</h3>
Good presenters act as documentation of the business logic. 
Try to remove as much logic from the Views as possible. 
This results into clearer views and makes testing easier.  

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page]{:target="_blank"}.

If we take a look at our GreetPresenter. 
Here we pass message of the view. 
Our GreetActivity needs to do and know as little as possible.
