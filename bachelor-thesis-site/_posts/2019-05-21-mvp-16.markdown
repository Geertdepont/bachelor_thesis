<h3>Why?</h3>
The view layer of Android apps tends to become
bloated with responsibilities, and hence becomes harder to
maintain. In order to alleviate such problem, Activities and
Fragments can be provided with preprocessed data ready
to be displayed. This can be achieved by delegating data processing tasks to one or more dedicated components. 
In such manner, Activities and Fragments are relieved from the task
of transforming and filtering domain-specific data, potentially
improving the testability and usability of the app.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page].
Let us take a look at the ViewUsersActivity which implements the ViewUsersView. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/c026944fc859a456ba6edbc7dccc2a3a.js"></script>

The only responsibility of the view is too show the data.
	Which is set in the view function.
	Whenever the ViewUsersActivity is start up, it asks the ViewUserPresenter to show the users.  


<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/7f1bddfb7def8c483b524f92cab10366.js"></script>

The ViewUserPresenter asks the ViewUserInteractor to get the users.
	If the ViewUserInteractor can find it, the users will be returned. 
	Otherwise the <b>onError()</b> method from the ViewUserPresenter is invoked.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/8ffeed7e2ae3abdc0d0114e75484ab30.js"></script>

Our DataManager then asks the helper to return the users. 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/4f94708f38f2698e755b030eecaa492d.js"></script>

In our DbHelper we return the data in which the view it was specified. 
Which is a List<User>.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/d32cf2eb0d298e7d543634dcfdf8006a.js"></script>

The presenter then just provides the showUsers function from the ViewUsersView with the 
List<User>
