<h3>Why?</h3>
In accordance to the clean architecture principles,
all components related to the framework should be grouped
in the outer architectural layer. This includes all components
which contain Android specific implementations, which should
not be present in the business logic layers. Examples include,
in addition to the user interface model, the data persistence
module (e.g., LiveData, DAOs, ORMs, Shared Preferences,
Retrofit, etc.) and eventual dependency injection frameworks.

<h3>Example</h3>
Everything related to the Android Framework should be in the view component.
