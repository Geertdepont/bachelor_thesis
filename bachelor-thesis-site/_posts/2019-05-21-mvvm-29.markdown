<h3>Why?</h3>
In the context of mobile applications,
consistency of data can become an issue. While caching
mechanisms allow to save energy and bandwidth, multiple data
sources can create inconsistencies and even conflicting Views.
In order to avoid such issues, it is recommended to designate
a dedicated component as single source of truth for the
entire app. Specifically, in the context of MVVM, the Room
persistence library13 is an official architectural component of
Android which is specifically tailored for such task.s


<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example].

In our example the viewModel contains only one database.
Whenever someone creates a Repository, an instance of the NoteDatabase gets requested.
This NoteDatabase is a singleton, so each repository will contain the same database. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/6c49b1e410789359624d30622c82c03d.js"></script>

To retrieve or insert data into the database, the noteDao has to be used.

Check this [page][architecture-example] to view the complete repository.
