<h3>Why?</h3>
Taking full advantage of libraries does not only save time, but could also be an improvement of 
your own implementation. Since multiple users could have been working on this implementation and many hands make light work.
 However do check the ratings of the library before using it. Or dive into the code of the library. This way you can
see that you are working with high quality and bug free code.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][MVVM-example]{:target="_blank"}. 
This example uses RxJava. Which is a library for creating and 
receiving asynchronous calls by creating Observers and Observables.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/047f1270a4745522b26927ae208eabfe.js"></script>

In the getContributorList() method, we actually perform multiple API requests.
myAPI.getRepositories() returns the Repositories from my github account.
Then .flatMapIterable(x -> x) flattens a stream of iterables. Then for each repository, we fetch 
the contributors, and sort them based on the amount of contributions.

If we had to write this code without RxJava, we would end up with a for loop within two nested callbacks. 
Which would lead to ugly code.

Checkout the [RXJava documentation][RX-Java]{:target="_blank"} to understand more about <b>Observers</b> and <b>Observables</b>

      <td>There are lots and lots of opensource libraries available in Github for you to use for FREE. But don’t get too excited and start using libraries blindly. Check the number of stars that particular library has, the more the better. Check if the author of that library have also created some other popular libraries as well. Check the issues (both open and closed), which can give you a better idea of how robust and stable the library is in production. If you can afford the time, you should dive into the code of that library and check yourself if its really worth it.</td>
