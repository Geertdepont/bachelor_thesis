doc: "For example, to ensure that Views display upto-date content, it is recommended that ViewModels expose
      states rather than just events. This can be achieved by bundling
      together the data that needs to be displayed. In such way,
      when one of the fields to be displayed changes, a new state is
      emitted and the View is updated. This entails that each user
      interaction involves an action in the ViewModel, enabling a
      clean separation of concerns between MVVM components."

<h3>Why?</h3>
For example, to ensure that Views display upto-date content, it is recommended that ViewModels expose
states rather than just events. This can be achieved by bundling
together the data that needs to be displayed. In such way,
when one of the fields to be displayed changes, a new state is
emitted and the View is updated. This entails that each user
interaction involves an action in the ViewModel, enabling a
clean separation of concerns between MVVM components.


<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example]{:target="_blank"}.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVVM_event.png" alt="MVVM event diagram" width="85%">
</figure>

This is our whole application.
	There is no business logic in the view.
	All the business logic is moved to the ViewModel
When we want to add a new Note we start a new AddNoteActivity.
If we submit the form with the Note details, the note is then submitted to the NoteViewModel which then handles the request.
