<h3>Why?</h3>
Views contain attributes which can be visible and non-visible. 
It is the Presenterâ€™s task to change the state of the View. 
However, whenever an Activity is killed, it is not the task of the 
Presenter to check this and reconfigure this Activity.


<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page]{:target="_blank"}.


<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVPLogin_showUsers.png" alt="Login Injection" width="600">
</figure>

As can be seen in this graph. 
	Views are passive.
	They only do what their presenters tell them to do.
