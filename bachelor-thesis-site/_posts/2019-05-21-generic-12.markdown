<h3>Why?</h3>
Using one single source of data, allows for each component to only depend on the one below it. 
If we want to add a local database to improve the userâ€™s experience, the component above does not need to know a local database has been added.
 Because the data supplied to the above layer remains the same. If however a repository was not used each component would have to maintain its own local database. 
 Which could lead to inconsistent data, and repeated code.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page]{:target="_blank"} which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

We retrieve the data from the service and save it in the cache. 
Whenever a user requests the employee data within 5 seconds, the data is retrieved from the Repository.

Even though we have multiple sources of data, for the Presenter there only exists one source of data which is
the <b>EmployeeRepository</b>.

Check out the [Github page][github-page]{:target="_blank"} to view the complete repository.
