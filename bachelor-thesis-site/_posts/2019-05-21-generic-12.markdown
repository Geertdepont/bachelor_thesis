<h3>Why?</h3>
Using one single source of data, allows for each component to only depend on the one below it. 
If we want to add a local database to improve the userâ€™s experience, the component above does not need to know a local database has been added.
 Because the data supplied to the above layer remains the same. If however a repository was not used each component would have to maintain its own local database. 
 Which could lead to inconsistent data, and repeated code.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page] which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

Retrieve data from the service and save in cache.

If we want, we can add a database to our repository. And return the employees from our database, and the mainPresenter would not know the difference.
