<h3>Description</h3>
When developing an Android app, a common issue which might
emerge is related to restoring the state of Views. This issue
can be solved by adapting slightly the architecture of apps.
Specifically a data manager component (e.g., a data store or
Jetpack Repository) can be introduced. This component is
responsible for data related tasks such as fetching data from the
network, caching results or returning already cached data. By
scoping such component at the app level and not at the one of
single Activities, issues relative to restoring View states, e.g.,
in the occurrence of a screen orientation change, are solved
through an architecturally maintainable solution.


<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page]{:target="_blank"} which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

If the employees were already retrieved within 5000 milliseconds, the repository returns the 
cache instead of making a new API request.

In the mainActivity when the button is clicked, the function showEmployees is called from the 
MainPresenter. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/64ab029fdf46c051eae227887eec24cf.js"></script>

The MainPresenter then asks the repository to show the users, which it will listen to with using 
the onSuccess or onError function. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/e8e9996406425a39462b5f03ec0896ff.js"></script>

The repository contains a EmployeeService which makes API requests and a 
EmployeeCache.

When the getList() function from the Repository is called.
It checks if the cache is still valid. That is if the data was recently updated and not null.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/e484aa2688cac63a9284cc156da2a000.js"></script>

If not, then a new listener is created. Which is used during the API request.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/6ecccdffb113b1b2e581775384f4bc6c.js"></script>

This results in a faster response. If this data was stored in the MainActivity and
this activity would be destroyed, the data would be lost. 
To retrieve the data again a new request would have to be performed, which results in a bad user experience.

      <td>Provide a cache for the Model to restore the View state. In my opinion, solving the “restore state” problem requires adapting a bit the app architecture. A great solution in line with this thoughts was proposed in this article. Basically, the author suggests caching network results using an interface like a Repository or anything with the aim to manage data, scoped to the application and not to the Activity (so that it can survive to orientation changes).</td>
