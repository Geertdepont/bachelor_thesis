<h3>Why?</h3>
Injecting presenters using Dagger reduces null checks and setPresenter() methods. 
Whenever an activity is used, Dagger couples the view with the Presenter.
 Which ultimately results into clearer code.



<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page].

The ViewUserModule provides the ViewUserComponent with the ViewUserPresenter.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/bb5770a60eff27f2da993c3f46a140d0.js"></script>

This ViewUserPresenter gets initialized with the viewUsersView. Which is added when the 
module is instantiated.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/6bfd1948147766a44579173049aaa979.js"></script>

Which happens in the viewUsersActivity.	So whenever a new Presenter is created, the Presenter always has a relationship with a view. So this is never null.
