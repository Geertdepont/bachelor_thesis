<h3>Why?</h3>
Using a cache to store data, enhances the userâ€™s experience. Activities are destroyed 
constantly. Retrieving data from the server every time an activity would be destroyed, 
would be a waste of mobile data and a bad user experience. 
A synchronization of a local database and the webservice can solve this problem. 
Whenever the local database is empty, or the data is not valid, retrieve data from the web server.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [application][github-page] which retrieves employees from this url: http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/

If the employees were already retrieved within 5000 milliseconds, the repository returns the 
cache instead of making a new API request.

In the mainActivity when the button is clicked, the function showEmployees is called from the 
MainPresenter. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/64ab029fdf46c051eae227887eec24cf.js"></script>

The MainPresenter then asks the repository to show the users with the getList(this) function, 
which it will listen to with using the onSuccess or onError function.

The repository contains a EmployeeService and a EmployeeCache. 
The EmployeeService makes API requests.

When the getList() function from the Repository is called.
It checks if the cache is still valid. That is if the data was recently updated and not null.

If not, then a new listener is created. Which is used during the API request.
Using a cache results in a faster response.
