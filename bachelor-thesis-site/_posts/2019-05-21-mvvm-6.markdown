<h3>Why?</h3>
The single responsibility principle from the SOLID principles, leads to a creating a model for 
each future of the app. 
Each ViewModel references to it’s own repository instead of referencing the database directly.
 This results in cleaner code, and repetitions of the similar code.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example]{:target="_blank"}.

Every viewModel creates its own repository, which in its turn has access to the one database.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/Geertdepont/0cf01c5b3504ad226e946d261908cf44.js"></script>

And the NoteRepository has access to the global used database.
