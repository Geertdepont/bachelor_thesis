<h3>Why?</h3>
Android apps must require permissions before accessing specific data or certain system activities, like accessing the Internet.
 All these permission need to be specified in the  AndroidManifest.xml.
  And the certain system feature can then only be used if the user allows it.
  
<h3>Example</h3>
Since we use the internet in our [MVP BossApplication][boss-application]{:target="_blank"} we need to specify this permission in our AndroidManifest.xml file.
