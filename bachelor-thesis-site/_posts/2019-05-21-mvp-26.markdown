<h3>Why?</h3>
There is no need for Presenters to communicate with each other. 
Whenever an event happens. The Presenter sends it to the model. 
From which the other Presenter then can retrieve the new data. 

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page].

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVPLogin_depicted.png" alt="Login Injection" width="700">
</figure>

Presenters do not have to talk with eachother.
	Whenever an Event happens at for example the addUserView. 
	The Presenter let it sink to the model, and other Presenters will find for example a new user.
