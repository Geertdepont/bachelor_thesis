doc: "Passing context to ViewModel instances can result in a dangerous practice. In fact by storing the
      reference to an Activity in a ViewModel, once the Activity gets
      destroyed (e.g., due to a screen rotation), a memory leak could
      occur. By quoting a Google Android Developer Advocate:
      “The consumer of the data should know about the producer,
      but the producer - the ViewModel - doesn’t know, and doesn’t
      care, who consumes the data.” In order to adhere to this
      guideline, the LiveData architectural class provided by the
      Jetpack library can be used, so that Activities can simply
      observe the changes of the ViewModel’s data."

<h3>Why?</h3>
Passing context to ViewModel instances can result in a dangerous practice. In fact by storing the
reference to an Activity in a ViewModel, once the Activity gets
destroyed (e.g., due to a screen rotation), a memory leak could
occur. By quoting a Google Android Developer Advocate:
“The consumer of the data should know about the producer,
but the producer - the ViewModel - doesn’t know, and doesn’t
care, who consumes the data.” In order to adhere to this
guideline, the LiveData architectural class provided by the
Jetpack library can be used, so that Activities can simply
observe the changes of the ViewModel’s data.


<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example]{:target="_blank"}.

Our viewModels do not store activities or instances of an activity in the view model.
