<h3>Why?</h3>
There is no need for Presenters to communicate with each other. 
Whenever an event happens. The Presenter sends it to the model. 
From which the other Presenter then can retrieve the new data. 

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP login Application][github-page]{:target="_blank"}.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVPLogin_depicted.png" alt="Login Injection" width="90%">
</figure>

Presenters do not have to talk with eachother.
	Whenever an Event happens at for example the addUserView. 
	The Presenter let it sink to the model, and other Presenters will find for example a new user.

      <td>How does a “ChildPresenter” communicate with its “ParentPresenter”? From my point of view such ParentChild relations are a code smell, because they introduce a direct coupling between both Parent and Child, which leads to code that is hard to read, hard to maintain, where changing requirement affects a lot of components (hence it’s a virtually impossible task in large systems) and last but not least introduces shared state that is hard to predict and even harder to reproduce and debug.</td>
