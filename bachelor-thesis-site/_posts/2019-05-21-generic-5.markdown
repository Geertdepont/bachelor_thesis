<h3>Why?</h3>
Picking the
right architectural pattern (e.g., MVP or MVVM) for the
context and business goals of the app is a crucial decision. By
adhering to an architectural patter selected a priori, separating
responsibilities into components becomes a more straightforward process, and the growth of architectural technical debt is
hindered. It is important to note that, when a certain level of
adaptability/maintainability is not required, the selection of an
ill-suited architectural pattern might lead to over-engineering.
Choosing the architectural pattern to adopt is hence a nontrivial decision which should be taken by considering the
context of apps, and their business/organizational goals.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created two examples:
<ul>
<li>MVVM example</li>
<li>MVP example</li>
</ul>

Our [MVVM example][github-page]{:target="_blank"} depicted:

</figure>

Both the MVVM architecture and the MVP are both recommended architectures when developing Android applications.
As we can see choosing these architectures each component (model, view, presenter/ ViewModel) has its own responsibilities.
Which makes improves testing and so also maintainability because each component can be tested separately.
So whenever a test fails, it can be directly seen from which component this test fails.

Check out both the [MVVM example][architecture-example]{:target="_blank"} and the [MVP example][github-page]{:target="_blank"} on these links.
