<h3>Why?</h3>
Picking the
right architectural pattern (e.g., MVP or MVVM) for the
context and business goals of the app is a crucial decision. By
adhering to an architectural patter selected a priori, separating
responsibilities into components becomes a more straightforward process, and the growth of architectural technical debt is
hindered. It is important to note that, when a certain level of
adaptability/maintainability is not required, the selection of an
ill-suited architectural pattern might lead to over-engineering.
Choosing the architectural pattern to adopt is hence a nontrivial decision which should be taken by considering the
context of apps, and their business/organizational goals.
2) MVP-specific Android Architecture Guidelines: The second most considered theme regards practices related to the
MVP architectural pattern. In total, 40 practices are collected
and synthesized in the following 12 MVP-specific guidelines
