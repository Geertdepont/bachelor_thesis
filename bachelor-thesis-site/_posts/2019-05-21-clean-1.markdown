<h3>Why?</h3>
By adhering to
the clean architecture principles, the innermost layers of an
app (i.e., where all the business logic of the app resides)
should be “frontend agnostic”. This means that this layers are
completely decoupled from the Android framework, and could
be ideally implemented as pure Java packages. Additionally,
as this layers represent the core of Android apps, they should
be developed before all other layers. Changes to the innermost
layers should be driven exclusively by business decisions.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVP example][github-page].

If we take a look at our MVP example we see that almost everything is decoupled from our 
Android framework. Only the Activity is coupled to the Android framework. The Presenter only 
views this MainActivity as a View. So there is no direct link to the Android framework.

Each component can easily be tested. 
	Since the MainPresenter has no actual reference to the MainActivity the 
MainPresenter is Android-independent making the presenter testable without an emulator.

When the Presenter wants the view to show the users, it calls, mainView.showUsers(Employees).

These are methods accessible by the MainPresenter:

To achieve this, my proposal is about breaking up the project into 3 different layers, in which each one has its own purpose and works separately from the others. It is worth mentioning that each layer uses its own data model so this independence can be reached (you will see in code that a data mapper is needed in order to accomplish data transformation, a price to be paid if you do not want to cross the use of your models over the entire application).</td>
