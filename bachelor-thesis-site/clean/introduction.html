<h3>What is a clean architecture?</h3>

<b>In a Clean architecture,</b> the application is separated in layers.
Where the inner layers do not know anything about the outer layers
This makes your code: testable, framework independent, UI independent, independent of data management.

This can be visualized as:

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple <a href="https://github.com/Geertdepont/bachelor_thesis/tree/master/MVPLogin" target="_blank">MVP login Application</a>.

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/MVPLogin_depicted.png" alt="Login Injection" width="90%" />
</figure>

The MVP architecture is an example of a clean architecture:
<ul>
  <li><b>The Inner-layers</b> contain the interactors, the models, repositories etc,</li>
  <li><b>The Middle layers</b> contain the Presenters</li>
  <li><b>and the Outer layer</b> contains the User Interface</li>
</ul>

<br>
In our example the Activities contains the User Interface.
Which have a connection with the Presenters, which in their case talk to the interactors.
