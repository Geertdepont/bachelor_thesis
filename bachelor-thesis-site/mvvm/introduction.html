<h3>The Model-View-ViewModel architecture</h3>
The MVVM architecture consists of three components:
<ul>
  <li><b>Model</b> represents the datasource. This layer is accessed to update/store and retrieve the data.</li>
  <li><b>View-Model</b> exposes methods and variables for the view to use. </li>
  <li><b>View</b> uses the variables and methods from the View-Model.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Difference MVVM and MVP</h3>
In MVVM the ViewModel exposes it's methods and variables for the View to use it.
In MVP the Presenter has a one-to-one relationship with the View, and decides what the view should do.

<h3>Example</h3>
We created a simple [MVVM example][architecture-example]{:target="_blank"}. As you can see, the activities perform the requests:
<b>getAllNotes()</b> and <b>insert(note)</b>. The ViewModels, perform the requests to the Model (NoteRepository).
